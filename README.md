## Advent of Code 2021

This repo is my attempt to solve the problems for [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/) 
in python programming language.

Below is the goal for each solution

- Solve the problem (ofcourse!!!)
- Analyze the problem in terms of time and memory complexity (Think Big O!)
- Find a better method/solution

_T/M stands for Time Memory Complexity_
